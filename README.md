A Django Web Forum

## Why Django?
Django is a Web framework written in Python. A Web framework is a software that supports the development of dynamic Web sites, applications, and services. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that solves many common problems associated with Web development, such as security features, database access, sessions, template processing, URL routing, internationalization, localization, and much more.

Using a Web framework, such as Django, enables us to develop secure and reliable Web applications very quickly in a standardized way, without having to reinvent the wheel.

## Web Board Project
Our project is a discussion board (a forum). The whole idea is to maintain several boards, which will behave like categories. Then, inside a specific board, a user can start a new discussion by creating a new topic. In this topic, other users can engage in the discussion posting replies.

We will need to find a way to differentiate a regular user from an admin user because only the admins are supposed to create new boards.
